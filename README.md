# SAM-SC2Bot
Our teams bot for the CMPUT350 Project, 2020. 

This bot works with the [Sc2LadderServer](https://github.com/solinas/Sc2LadderServer). Please ensure that this folder is in the same directory as our bots'. Cloning our project should add this directory automatically.

# Developer Install / Compile Instructions
## Requirements
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Starcraft 2 ([Windows](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/)) ([Linux](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#linux-packages)) 
* [Starcraft 2 Map Packs](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#map-packs)

## Windows

Download and install [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) if you need it. Building with Visual Studio 2019 not yet supported.

```bat
:: Clone the project
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheArcticGiraffe/CMPUT350TeamBot.git
$ cd CMPUT350TeamBot

:: Create build directory.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

:: Generate VS solution.
$ cmake ../ -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"

:: Build the project using Visual Studio.
$ start BasicSc2Bot.sln
```

## Mac

Note: Try opening the SC2 game client before installing. If the game crashes before opening, you may need to change your Share name:
* Open `System Preferences`
* Click on `Sharing`
* In the `Computer Name` textfield, change the default 'Macbook Pro' to a single word name (the exact name shouldn't matter, as long as its not the default name)

```bat
:: Clone the project
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheArcticGiraffe/CMPUT350TeamBot.git
$ cd CMPUT350TeamBot

:: Create build directory.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

:: Generate a Makefile
:: Use 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../' if debug info is needed
$ cmake ../

:: Build
$ make
```

# Playing against the built-in AI

In addition to competing against other bots using the [Sc2LadderServer](https://github.com/solinas/Sc2LadderServer), this bot can play against the built-in
AI by specifying command line argurments.

For example,

```
/BasicSc2Bot.exe -c -a Zerg -d Hard -m CactusValleyLE.SC2Map
```

will result in the bot playing against the Zerg built-in AI on Hard difficulty on the map CactusValleyLE.
